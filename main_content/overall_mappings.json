First, the bases of probability theory are introduced (e.g., set theory, definition of sample space, axioms, definition of probability and its main properties). Then, the random variables, both discrete and continuous, are formally defined together with the quantities characterizing them (e.g., expected value as a measure of location and variance as a measure of dispersion). Moreover, the concept of transformation of a random variable is defined and different methods are introduced to derive the probability of the transformed random variable. The concepts of convergence in probability and convergence in distribution are introduced along with the weak law of large number, the central limit theorem. Finally, the bivariate discrete random variable is introduced. An illustrative lecture about numerical methods for simulation of random variable concludes the course.",

The main fields we will be concerned with are discrete mathematics, linear algebra and algebra.\n\nError-correcting codes is not about programming, but about representing digital information in ways that are resilient to noise. It is used everywhere: in a DVD which can play flawlessly even though it is scratched, or a satellite-transmission which is undisturbed through bad atmospheric disturbance in stormy weather, or in high-speed internet and in mobile phone conversations. Without exaggerating, the information era would have been impossible without Coding Theory.\n\nMany of the best error-correcting codes we know are based on ingenious algebraic methods. This course is an introduction to the fundamental mathematical model in coding theory and to the mathematics behind these algebraic codes. In order for the recipient to correct whatever errors appear, efficient algorithms will be needed for handling the algebraic objects; we will deal with this using both theoretical algebra and using a computer-algebra system.\n\nIn a nutshell: we will use algebra and develop algebraic methods to find good solutions to mathematical problems inspired by applications of Error-correcting Codes.\nLearning objectives\nA student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\nExplain the mathematical model of error-correcting codes and its relevance in traditional communication. Derive using a constructive method that there exist codes with good parameters.Give an algorithm (with exponential running time) for maximum likelihood decoding.\nDefine Reed-Solomon codes using polynomials in one variable and derive their basic parameters.\nProve mathematically the correctness of a decoding algorithm for Reed-Solomon codes and understand how to implement this decoding algorithm in a computer algebra system.\nDefine the ways in which transmission can fail, and estimate for a simple error-model the probability of these events.\nDefine Reed-Muller codes using polynomials in several variables and derive their basic parameters.\nProve Bezout's theorem concerning intersection points of algebraic curves and explain its role in Algebraic Geometry codes.\nDefine Algebraic Geometry codes using algebraic curves, derive their basic parameters and describe a decoding algorithm for them.\nExecute a project on algebraic codes and evaluate their efficiency.\nWork effectively in a group on a project with a mathematical and algorithmic core.\nWrite a report on a subject within algebraic error-correcting codes.\nContent\nThe course consists of lectures and exercise sessions. We start with introducing the mathematical model in the framework of linear algebra over finite fields, and we investigate the overall boundaries within it: Gilbert-Varshamov bound and exponential time decoding.\nNext important algebraic codes are introduced, Reed-Solomon codes where univariate polynomials are used as an algebraic tool. We consider an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes and show how it can be implemented in a computer algebra system. After this we generalize to Reed-Muller codes using multivariate polynomials. This in turn motivates the usage of algebraic curves, leading to Algebraic Geometry codes, where Bezout's theorem is used as an essential tool for analysis.\n01405 Algebraic Error-Correcting Codes (dtu.dk)",

Finally, annotation is a major problem in remote sensing, we plan to discuss how off-the-shelves self-supervision can be used as an alternative in this regard.

    "Foreign University Name": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology",
    "Foreign Course Description": "The course gives a broad overview of financial control in industrial enterprises and its relation to the environment in which the company acts. To plan and control the performance of the organisation at different levels, efficient control is required, based on the organisation's value creation strategy and the individual co-worker's behaviour. A central field in the course therefore deals with how to implement a general strategy and use it to control the activities.\nThe course consists of two parts.\nPart 1: During the first part of the course, students will learn to analyse and interpret financial reports. The students will acquire knowledge on analysing and understanding financial consequences of strategic and operational decisions. A distinction is made between the use of financial reports for planning and for measuring and following up results. The students will carry out financial analyses of real companies on the basis of accounting information found in the financial reports (the profit and loss account, the balance sheet and the cash flow analysis). Different categories of key indicators are introduced and used to compare companies, e.g. profitability measures.\nPart 2: The second part of the course focuses on management control. In this part, the students will work based on the analyses that were done during the first part of the course and design control systems to create sustainable profitability. In order for this to happen, the management must ensure that the activities are carried out according to established plans and that strategic aims are achieved. An important control mechanism to achieve this is the organisational structure that consists of different responsibility units in different parts of, and at different levels in the company. Another central field in the second part of the course is the control process. Which measures are used in the company and how well do these measures catch central aspects of the activities? How does one know when performance is \"good\", i.e. what is the performance compared with? Which reward systems are used by the company to create a desirable behaviour and to which indicators are rewards connected?\n---        ---\nIntended learning outcomes        On completion of the course, the student should be able to:\n1. independently calculate, analyse, compare, evaluate critically and justify important financial key indicators, such as performance measures.\n2. based on scientific studies and proven experience describe and account for the different aspects of the strategic financial control.\n3. with overall view critically, independently and creatively formulate and handle complex issues, analyse, quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the financial and non-financial situation of an industrial corporation and based on research identify improvement measures.\n4. with overall view, critically and independently interpret and analyse different types of decentralised organisational units.\n5.discuss and contrast similarities and differences between different types of responsibility units qualitatively, and evaluate their financial performance.\n6.give an account of different methods for internal pricing.\n7.based on scientific studies give an account of and justify different types of performance measures, standards, budgets and rewards.\n8.based on scientific studies explain behavioural aspects of financial control and the need to adapt the financial control to the situation, as well as present and discuss one's conclusions and the knowledge behind these, and propose investments and improvement measures.",

    "Foreign Course Description": "Neural networks are mature, flexible, and powerful non-linear data-driven models that have successfully solved many complex tasks in science and engineering. The advent of the deep learning paradigm, i.e., training (neural) networks to simultaneously learn an optimal data representation and a model for solving the requested task, has further boosted neural networks research and development. These models nowadays achieve state-of-the-art performance in natural language processing, text modeling, gene expression modeling, and image recognition, to name a few examples. This course provides a broad introduction to artificial neural networks (ANN), starting from the traditional feedforward (FFNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks, till the most successful deep-learning architectures including convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memories (LSTM). The course aims at providing students with a theoretical background and the practical skills to understand and use ANN and, at the same time, become familiar and with Deep Learning for solving complex engineering problems.",

    "Foreign Course Description": "General course objectives\nThe dynamic excitation of civil engineering structures often occurs due to environmental forces from wind, waves and earthquakes, or from traffic loading, collisions and explosions. The aim of this course is to provide an understanding of dynamic effects in large structures and enable students to perform dynamic analysis of structures with a single or multiple degrees of freedom, using analytical as well as numerical methods.\n\nLearning objectives\nA student who has met the objectives of the course will be able to:\n* Formulate the equation of motion for dynamic structures and systems.\n* Determine the solution for free and forced vibrations of systems with a single degree of freedom, and explain the meaning of a natural frequency, damping ratio and resonance.        \n* Apply separation of variables and the finite element method to solve the equation of motion for vibrating beams.        \n* Determine natural frequencies and vibration forms for systems with multiple degrees of freedom.        \n* Apply modal analysis to compute the dynamic response of systems with multiple degrees of freedom.        \n* Explain quasi-static system reduction methods that minimize computational costs in dynamic analyses.        \n* Use Newmark-based time integration methods to compute the dynamic response of systems with multiple degrees of freedom.        \n* Explain the effect of the most common types of damping mechanisms.        \n* Design the governing parameters of viscous dampers and tuned mass dampers (TMDs) on flexible structures.\n* Conduct a dynamic analysis and describe the results in written reports.\n\nContent\nThe fundamental concepts of dynamics are introduced for simple systems with a single degree of freedom. Hereby, aspects such as natural frequencies, damping and resonance are introduced by determining the system’s free vibrations and its forced response to harmonic and transient loading.\n\nThe foundation of the dynamics of flexible structures is subsequently described by the theory for free beam vibrations, while the connection between this continuous element and its corresponding discrete structural model is illustrated by applying the finite element method to solve the partial differential equation. The dynamic analysis of discrete structures with multiple degrees of freedom is then conducted by modal analysis, based on a series representation by the vibration forms of the structure. Hereby, the influence of the load’s frequency content and its spatial distribution is considered, together with the potential of quasi-static system reduction techniques.\n\nFor flexible structures, the damping of the system is crucial for the magnitude of the dynamic response, why various naturally occurring damping mechanisms are scrutinized. Furthermore, the effect of external dampers on flexible structures is treated, including the use of tuned mass dampers. For flexible structures with local dampers or advanced loading, the dynamic equations are solved by direct time integration using the Newmark method.\n\nThe theoretical content of the course is illustrated by simple experiments and treated in exercises, which can be solved in Python. The reports constitute a part of the total course assessment. The first report is handed in individually, while the subsequent two reports are prepared in groups.",

These skills are fundamental to achieve the learning goals: (a) analyze simple problems in business and society using relevant analytical techniques/models; (b) assess economic/management decisions with a coherent moral reasoning.\nDescription        The course gives the foundations of probability theory. First, the bases of probability theory are introduced (e.g., set theory, definition of sample space, axioms, definition of probability and its main properties). Then, the random variables, both discrete and continuous, are formally defined together with the quantities characterising them (e.g., expected value as a measure of location and variance as a measure of dispersion). Moreover, the concept of transformation of a random variable is defined and different methods are introduced to derive the probability of the transformed random variable. The concepts of convergence in probability and convergence in distribution are introduced along with the weak law of large number, the central limit theorem. Finally, the bivariate discrete random variable is introduced. An illustrative lecture about numerical methods for simulation of random variable concludes the course.",

After this course, students will be able to: 1- analyze simple problems in marketing and consumer behavior using relevant analytical models; 2 - identify challenges and opportunities in consumer behavior and marketing; 3 - evaluate management decisions in local, global, and international environments that involve consumer behavior; 4 - evaluate economic/management decisions that involve consumer behavior in the context of sustainability.\nDescription\tConsumer decisions are ubiquitous in daily life and they can have long-ranging and important consequences for (financial) well-being and individual health. To help people making better choices it is important to understand the factors that influence these decisions. Towards this goal, we will explore how consumer behavior is shaped by social influences, situational and cognitive constraints, as well as by emotions, motivations, evolutionary forces, neuronal processes, and individual differences. A main focus of the class will be on the cognitive processes underlying judgment and decision making behavior. Across all topics covered in class, we will engage with basic theoretical work as well as with groundbreaking empirical research and current scientific debates, including sustainability, open science, and global justice.",

    "Foreign Course Description": "Interest in entrepreneurship within established organisations has intensified due to various events taking place on business and social levels. On the social front, there is a rising interest among employees to create something meaningful on their own. Increasingly, employees have a strong need for individual autonomy and expression in their workplace. In the absence of such freedom, talented employees may leave out of frustration to search for an institution that can provide the meaning and the environment to achieve their self-actualization. Corporate entrepreneurship is one method of stimulating and capitalizing on employees' need to think of new ideas and do things better for their organisation. On a business level, an organization needs self-renewal, which involves transformation through redefinition of its business concepts, reorganization of its business relationships and reengineering of its business processes. Creating a new venture from scratch is challenging, but developing it within an existing organization is a totally different ball game. This course focuses on corporate entrepreneurship with four key elements: new business venturing, innovativeness, selfrenewal and proactiveness. It has two primary objectives. First, the course aims to enable the students to apply corporate entrepreneurship-related concepts in practice.\nSecond, it seeks to broaden the students' education by helping them to appreciate the application of corporate entrepreneurship knowledge to companies.

    "Foreign Course Description": "Game theoretic analysis is fundamental to understanding modern business strategies and forms the basic infrastructure of strategy courses. The unit teaches the basic tools of Game Theory, and introduces a structured way to think about business interactions. Game theory originated in the middle of the twentieth century as the general study of strategic interactions and has found applications in a wide variety of contexts including economics, psychology, politics and evolutionary biology. It is this generality that is the source of its power.\nAccordingly, the unit develops game theory broadly with applications to strategic situations, including business as well as more general contexts.",

They will be pressed to pursue more specific ones that elucidate the relationship between narrative and narrative devices. They will learn craft through group and individual projects, hone writing skills, study space and time in literature, and bring to bear analytic instruments from a variety of disciplines including culture studies, literary criticism, anthropology, folklore, history, among others, to negotiate the deceptively simple terrain of story and narrative.",

We will dig into what it means for the IPCC to be an intergovernmental body, the underlying reports that makeup the AR6 assessment cycle, and what the future holds for the IPCC. In doing so we will explore the current science and knowledge around land use, oceans and cryosphere, mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage, vulnerability and how that is presented in a 'policy relevant but not policy prescriptive' format. Students will be able to evaluate key questions and concepts around climate change as they find and understand how they are included in the IPCC reports. They will then learn to assess and analyze the questions/concepts in the context of the IPCC findings and see how those findings are integrated in the international policy space.

    "Foreign Course Description": "Ultra Low Power Microcontroller (MCU) – Firmware Programming and Sensors Interfacing Using Arm Cortex-M (STM32) Microcontrollers Microprocessors are used to execute extensive and generic applications. In contrast to that, microcontrollers (MCUs) are low-cost and low-power embedded chips with program memory and data memory built into the device. They are widely used to execute simple tasks within one specific application domain (i.e., sensor devices, wearable systems, and IoT devices). Microcontrollers demand precise and resource-saving programming. Therefore, it is necessary to know the processor architecture, relevant hardware peripherals (clocks, timers, interrupts, ADC, serial interfaces, etc.), and their implementation in the targeted device. The STM32 family from STMicroelectronics has gained popularity in the industry due to its large product portfolio, solid documentation, and ease of use. This course aims to develop a basic understanding of hard and software concepts for embedded systems and their application in real-world problems. A combination of theory (20%) and practical implementation (80%) should enable students to conduct high-level firmware programming for microcontrollers. Besides programming the MCU, this includes the interaction with analog and digital sensors, data management, on-device processing, and wireless data exchange. More advanced topics, such as hardware-accelerated digital signal processing (DSP), machine learning, and real-time operating systems, will be discussed as part of individual projects if needed. The main programming language will be C.",

    "IITB Course Descriptions": "History of Literature, taking English as an example, may be taken up for study in order to understand how the history of English Literature is related to canon-formation. Standard texts on this subject, observe trajectories of tracing the evolution of British literary history. This course will interrogate the trajectory, in ways ranging from accommodating more women authors in the literary history, to re-imagining the conventional subdivision of the writers of each age as major and minor. The course may also look at alternative modes of structuring histories of literature, following departures from diachronic, national-language models, to synchronic models that look at interrelations between different literatures produced in different languages, in which connections emerge because of a multitude of factors (e.g. colonialism, solidarity movements connecting different disenfranchised groups, and so on). For example: 1. European drama—its development seen in synchronic developments across different languages in different nodal points in time (e.g. the Early Modern Period; 19th-century drama, often termed as “Victorian” in the context of English literature; 20th-century interrelations between Indian and European drama); Or, Metaphysical poetry (connected in numerous ways with continental European poetry; with religious emblem books, etc.) Such an approach leads us to reconsider the terms of literary periodisation itself, both in English and in other languages. Questions of periodisation and the social-historical-political are ingrained in how the course examines what ‘literature’ or the ‘literary’ has been imagined to be, how it has been studied in specific points in history, or how nature of such study has shifted over time and space. In this last endeavour, the course is expected to converse with other common courses offered from other disciplines. Topics include: 1.Study of literature by conventional national divisions and periodisation though ‘age’ model: alternative approaches 2The making of the English canon, rethinking the canon, canon formation and values such as questions of literary taste 3 Notions of minor authors and minor literatures, ‘minority voices’ 4 The ways the same text has been read in different places, spaces, and time, sometimes reflexively/relationally/revisionally: for example, William Shakespeare’s The Tempest, Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe, Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, Rabindranath Tagore’s The Home and the World, Premchand’s “Sadgati,” U. R. Ananthamurthy’s Samskara 5 Synchronic and diachronic literary exchanges that have reinforced or disrupted canons and canonicity: translations, adaptations, appropriations, collaborations",

The class explores a multitude of concepts and theories from different behavioral sciences to fully appreciate what drives consumption choices and experiences. The course is split into two main paradigms of consumer research: consumer psychology and consumer culture.\nThe consumer psychology module examines psychological processes and biases affecting decisions, with a focus on applying these insights to consumption. Adults make around 35,000 decisions daily, each with potential impacts. The module covers findings from Behavioral Economics and Consumer Research, discussing key theories and offering advice for Marketing and Management, emphasizing heuristics and biases.\nIn the consumer culture module, we examine the cultural, social, and historical aspects of consumption, focusing on how consumer culture shapes and organizes our experiences. This includes studying how social class influences consumption, how consumption affects identity formation, gender performance through consumption, and the dynamics of consumer groups like subcultures and brand communities.\nThe course covers many concepts but emphasizes reflection, criticism, and creative application.\nUnderstanding consumer behavior involves multiple perspectives.

Indeed, we argue that project management is the second most important skill of engineers. Therefore, project management competences are fundamental to all DTU students.\n\nThrough the course, the student develops                              unique insights into how project management is practiced through the analysis of a \"real\" world project. Furthermore, each student will experience the role of the project manager as each student will be responsible for planning and executing at least one day of the group work.\n\nThe course is organized around classical and online lectures, reading material, group exercises/games and assignments, peer- reviews and multiple-choice quizzes. As a large portion of the learning activities occurs in groups, class participation is fundamental!\n\nThrough the group work, the students will analyze a real-life project. Here they are expected to apply tools, concepts, models and theories, both appropriately and critically, to understand the reasons for the project 'success' or 'failure', identify challenges and develop recommendations.\n\nIMPORTANT (TO DO BEFORE THE BEGINNING OF THE COURSE): Every student is expected to identify an exciting project and present it to the class on the first day of the course. The project should be completed, or close to completion, so it is possible to analyze its 'success'.\n\nThe lectures will be in English, and we strongly encourage the students to write the final report in English. By far, most bachelor courses are in Danish. However, courses at master level are mostly, if not exclusively, in English. To facilitate the transition, DTU encourages the use of English language in some bachelor courses. This course is one of them. If the student does not feel comfortable with English, they are allowed to write the report in Danish.",

For example, it is not possible to fully understand support vector machines in statistical learning, nodal pricing in electricity markets, the fundamental welfare theorems in economics, or Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games without understanding the duality theory of convex optimization.\n\nThe course primarily focuses on techniques for formulating decision problems as convex optimization models that can be solved with existing software tools. The exact formulation of an optimization model often determines whether the model can be solved within seconds or only within days, and whether it can be solved for ten variables or up to 10^6 variables. The course does not address optimization algorithms but covers the theory that is necessary to follow advanced courses on algorithm design such as EE-556: Mathematics of data: from theory to computation.\n\nTentative Course Outline:\n\nWeek 1: Introduction/Convex Sets\n\nWeek 2: Convex Sets/Convex Functions\n\nWeek 3: Convex Functions/ Convex Optimization Problems\n\nWeek 4: Convex Optimization Problems\n\nWeek 5: Introduction to Duality Theory\n\nWeek 6: Optimality Conditions/ Separation Theorems\n\nWeek 7: Strong Duality\n\nWeek 8: Optimization in Statistics and Machine Learning\n\nWeek 9: Optimization in Statistics and Machine Learning\n\nWeek 10: Convexifying Nonconvex Problems\n\nWeek 11: Convexifying Nonconvex Problems\n\nWeek 12: Robust Optimization\n\nWeek 13: Robust Optimization\n\nWeek 14: Stochastic\n\nProgramming",

Companies are increasingly asked\nto contribute to fighting societal challenges and struggle to find answers beyond philanthropy.\nEntrepreneurship offers promising ways to identify innovative ideas that benefit business and society\nalike.\nEntrepreneurs need to be able to provide persuasive startup proposals. Before writing the proposal, they\nneed to conduct appropriate research and analyses to come up with a coherent idea. Subsequently, they\nhave to conduct a professional presentation on their idea to persuade potential investors.\nThe aim of Business Game is to simulate the work of entrepreneurs and consultants seeking to address\nsocietal challenges. Being successful requires the broad application of conceptual lenses and methods\n(from other Bachelor courses). We will focus on entrepreneurial thinking to respond to societal challenges\nand how they can be implemented (through a new venture or in collaboration with an existing\norganization). We will do so in a structured way to identify ideas that create value for a business and\nsociety alike. Students have to come up with a compelling proposal and present it.\nThe course provides participants with a hands-on approach to learn about the work of entrepreneurs. We\ndiscuss societal challenges and ways to apply entrepreneurial thinking to them during lectures. Students\nwill then use several tools to come up with their own ideas. Since group work is a key component of this\ncourse, there will be multiple instances to receive feedback. This course asks students to actively reflect\non how to respond to real-world issues using the tools from their studies.\nThis course provides a pragmatic way to deal with questions of sustainability and corporate responsibility\nby discussing ways of how pressing societal challenges can be addressed using entrepreneurial thinking.",

The latter is then discretized using the Galerkin process and the finite element method. The notions of basic functions, function classes, Hilbert and Sobolev functional spaces and convergence, necessary for understanding the approach, are briefly described and the distinction between natural and essential boundary conditions is discussed. A generalization of the one-dimensional model problem by the introduction of various discontinuities (loading, section, material, ...) in the bar is then studied and the notion of high-order finite elements is addressed.\nFollowing an approach similar to that used for the one-dimensional problem, the course then focuses on the two-dimensional model problem of heat transfer by conduction up to its weak formulation discretized in two-dimensional finite elements with a scalar variable (temperature). The concepts of Lagrangian and serendipian, quadrangular and triangular parent finite elements are introduced, then used for the creation of two-dimensional finite elements with arbitrary geometry (geometrically deformed finite elements).\nAfter a study of the convergence of solutions approximated by two-dimensional finite elements, the course ends with a complete application example.",

The intention is to quickly and easily define certain keywords as arbitrage freedom and completeness, as well as martingals and martingal dimensions. We will use tree structures to model time trends for stock prices and information flows.\n\nDuring the second part, we will study models formulated in continuous time. The models we focus on are mainly stochastic differential equations. The underlying theory of Brownian movement, stochastic integrals, Ito's formula, changes in dimensions and numerators is reviewed and applied to option theory for both the stock and the fixed income market. For example, we derive Black-Scholes formula and how a replica portfolio for an option is created.",

    "Foreign Course Description": "Most of what students have been studied so far in economics applies to Western countries’ economies with strong institutions and generally well-functioning markets, even if not perfect. Half of the world population lives with less than $6.85 per day, meaning less than 200€ per month (adjusted for 2017 purchasing power parities) while in France, the RSA (Active Solidarity Income) is 600€ per month.\n\nThis course focuses on this other half of the world, where institutions are weak, where markets are often deficient – with limited access to banks, to insurance, no secure property rights, and widespread informality. To understand the economic lives of poor people we need to rethink how to do economics. Relying on the books Poor Economics: a Radical Rethinking of the Way to Fight Global Poverty by A. Banerjee and E. Duflo (both winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics) and Portfolios of the Poor: How the World’s Poor Live on $2 a Day (Princeton University Press, 2009), and using our economics toolbox, we will study some paradoxical aspects of life below the poverty line, such as why the poor need to borrow in order to save, what barriers to start and grow business they face, why having many children does not necessarily make you poorer...\n\nThis course is meant as an introduction to the field of development economics, which aims at understanding the economic forces at play in low and middle-income countries. After this class students will be able to understand and to have a critical view on development and poverty indicators — what is a poverty line? what are the mechanisms of a poverty trap? — and how, as economists, they can gain a better understanding of the economics of the poor.",

    "IITB Course Descriptions": "The legacy of control is marked by a historic misconception that led theorists to presume that in every problem, the tasks of control, estimation and communication can be separated. This led to the widespread belief that deterministic controllers, superimposed with optimal state estimators and conventional communi- cation protocols, would be optimal in stochastic environments. Over time, several landmark papers revealed that nothing could be farther from the truth. We realize today that co-design of communication and control offers orders of magnitude of improvements in performance over separate design and that in some cases, it is essential to change the very notion of information for purposes of control. These issues are exacerbated in the control of decentralized systems evolving in random environments. Examples of such systems are smart cities, transportation systems, power grids, gaming and financial markets. This complex subject requires simultaneous application of control theory and communication theory. At present these elements are taught separately in courses designed either exclusively for deterministic control theory, or exclusively for communication theory. This leaves behind a gap, namely blending insights from both disciplines to arrive at approaches for networked control problems. This course seeks to fill this gap. It will begin with traditional, or so called “classical” stochastic control. Then cover information/communication theory, and finally cover important topics in networked control. A unity between decentralized decision theory, information theory and control theory will be evident by the end of this course. The course will benefit all students interested in stochastic control, communication/information theory, decentralized decision making, and game theory. Contents: - Classical stochastic control and Markov decision processes. Bellman equation, dynamic programming and LP formulation. - Partially observed Markov decision processes. Reduction to the fully observed case. Linear quadratic Gaussian problem, Certainty equivalence and separation principle. Information structure. - Witsenhausen problem. Discussion on current state of the art. - Information theory. Introduction to entropy and mutual information.

The course will also aim to achieve the learning goals: (a) analyze simple problems in business and economics using relevant analytical techniques/models; (b) assess economic/management decisions with a coherent moral reasoning.    Description: The course gives the foundations of probability theory. First, the bases of probability theory are introduced (e.g., set theory, definition of random space, axiom's definition of probability and its main properties). Then, the random variables, both discrete and continuous, are formally defined together with the quantities characterizing them (e.g., expected value as a measure of location and variance as a measure of dispersion). Moreover, the concept of transformation of a random variable is introduced and different methods are introduced to derive the probability of the transformed random variable. The concepts of convergence in probability and convergence in distribution are introduced along with the weak law of large number, the central limit theorem. Finally, the bivariate discrete random variable is introduced, an illustrative lecture about numerical methods for simulation of random variable concludes the course.",

In contrast to that, microcontrollers (MCUs) are low-cost and low-power embedded chips with program memory and data memory built into the device. They are widely used to execute simple tasks within their specific application domain (ie, sensor devices, wearable systems, and IoT devices). Microcontrollers demand processing and resource-saving programming. Therefore, it is necessary to know the processor architecture, relevant hardware peripherals (clocks, timers, interrupts, ADCs, serial interfaces, etc.), and their implementation in the targeted device. The STM32 family from STMicroelectronics has gained popularity in the industry due to its large project portfolio, solid documentation, and ease of use. This course aims to develop a basic understanding of hard and software concepts for embedded systems and their application in real-world problems. A combination of theory (80%) and practical implementation (80%) should enable students to conduct high-level firmware programming for microcontrollers. Besides programming the MCU, this includes the interaction with analog and digital sensors, data management, on-device processing, and wireless data exchange. More advanced topics, such as hardware-accelerated digital signal processing (DSP), machine learning, and real-time operating systems, will be discussed as part of individual projects if needed.

Continuous optimization typically occurs in learning model parameters while discrete optimization problems appear in inference and auxiliary tasks such as feature selection, data subset selection, model compression etc. In the first part of this course, we will cover continuous optimization with applications in machine learning. Topics to discuss will include Convexity, Gradient Methods, Proximal algorithms, Stochastic and Online Variants of mentioned methods, Coordinate Descent Methods, Subgradient Methods, Non-Convex Optimization, FrankWolfe, Accelerated Methods, Lagrange and Fenchel Duality, Second-Order Methods, Quasi-Newton Methods, Gradient-Free and Zero-Order Optimization. We will also cover some advanced topics including non-convex optimization, alternating minimization algorithms and parallel/distributed variants of algorithms. We will ground all these algorithms with applications and loss functions in machine learning (starting from logistic regression, linear regression, svms, matrix factorization right up to deep neural networks). Summarily,in Continuous Optimization we will cover topics such as Basics of Continuous Optimization, Convexity, Gradient Descent, Projected/Proximal GD, Subgradient Descent, Accelerated Gradient Descent, Newton & Quasi Newton, Duality: Legrange, Fenchel, Coordinate Descent, Frank Wolfe, Continuous Optimization in Practice, etc. The second part of this course will cover the fundamentals of discrete optimization. We will start with basic forms of combinatorial optimization (knapsack, s-t cuts/paths, matchings and matroids) and then discuss submodular functions and their applications. We will cover algorithms for submodular minimization and maximization under various combinatorial constraints. We will also discuss discrete probabilistic models such as Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs). We will ground all these algorithmic and theoretical results with real world applications in feature selection, summarization and diversified search, structured prediction, data subset selection and model compression. Summarily, in Discrete Optimization we will cover topics such as Linear Cost Problems with Applications in ML, Matroids, Spanning Trees, s-t paths, s-t cuts, Matchings, Covers (Set Covers, Vertex Covers, Edge Covers), Non-Linear Discrete Optimization, Submodular Functions and Applications in Machine Learning, Submodularity and Convexity, Submodular Minimization, Submodular Maximization, Beyond Minimization and Maximization: Other forms of Submodular Optimization, Discrete Optimization in Practice",

Analysis of the role of experience, Logical thinking, and free imagination in science. In particular, geometry and mechanics are discussed as examples, with special emphasis on the distinction between empirical facts and the language by which those facts are described.The basic ideas of modern physics are presented with emphasis on the contribution they can make toward the solution of philosophic questions, such as the status of theoretical terms, models, theories, the nature of time, space, causal and statistical law, and the conflict between philosophical creeds like materialism, idealism, pragmatism etc.The views on science: the Received View, Popper Kuhn, Lukatos, l be treated as central: What is art? Concepts of Imitation. Symbolization, Expression, Configuration. What is aesthetics? Theorizing about art and its relevance to creation, appreciation and criticism of art.Art and life: (a) art and society (Marxist approach); (b) art and psyche (Freudian approach).Art as an autonomous activity: art and form.What is aesthetic response?

First, the bases of probability theory are introduced (e.g., set theory, definition of sample space, axioms, definition of probability and its main properties). Then, the random variables, both discrete and continuous, are formally defined together with the quantities characterising them (e.g., expected value as a measure of location and variance as a measure of dispersion). Moreover, the concept of transformation of a random variable is defined and different methods are introduced to derive the probability of the transformed random variable. The concepts of convergence in probability and convergence in distribution are introduced along with the weak law of large number, the central limit theorem. Finally, the bivariate discrete random variable is introduced. An illustrative lecture about numerical methods for simulation of random variable concludes the course.",
